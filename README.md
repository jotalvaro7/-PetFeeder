This project is part of my university degree project, which consists of a backend and frontend with technologies such as angular 6, node js, mongodb as a database and mqtt (mosquitto) for the IoT connection (internet of things ). Currently I do not have much experience in the development of web pages but I hope to continue improving. Thank you

This project I do public for that person who needs help and this can be useful.
